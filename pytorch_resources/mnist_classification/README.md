### Classification of digits using MNIST

In this example, we will be using MNIST to classify digits.

- For easy loading of data, we will use the dataset that comes with `keras`. We will not be actually using `keras` other than for the dataset.
- `dataloading` is illustrated through an example, along with transformations we may want to make.
- One example where the data is loaded with pytorch package is also presented. This will read from files on disk, and can be scaled up to larger datasets as well.
